- What was your role / which stories did you work on
  - I primarily worked on the teams database and UI for being able to add and delete pokemon from teams.
- What was the biggest challenge? 
  - Using expo sqlite was the biggest challenge I encountered.
- Why was it a challenge? 
  - It was a challenge as it was a library I have not worked with before.
- How was the challenge addressed? 
  - Reading the documentation and learning from the examples shown.
- Favorite / most interesting part of this project
  - My favorite part of the project was having the images from the API show on the app.
- If you could do it over, what would you change? 
  - I would implement a better strategy in rendering a bigger list from the API so that the app would show more than 10 pokemon.
- What is the most valuable thing you learned? 
  - The most valuable thing I learned is using React Native along with Expo.

  - https://github.com/KrispyKris905/Project-1-Group-3/issues/38
- What was your role / which stories did you work on
  - I worked primarily on the db’s, api and the unit tests of the app.
- What was the biggest challenge?
  - (other than being a man down lol)
  - Essentially making tools for the other members to use. Because the DB’s were needed for a lot of the functions, my group members needed them to complete their tasks.
- Why was it a challenge?
  - There was a difference in how I thought they were going to implement their apps, and the functions they needed, and how I THOUGHT I needed the DB’s to be. This led to parts of the db just being not really useful. Also there was a problem with using js, and ts in the db, and it was changed after the db was ‘done’
- How was the challenge addressed?
  - Cris and Ashley went in, picked the parts of the db we already had that they wanted, and added or changed parts to fit their needs.
- Favorite / most interesting part of this project
  - Learning about unit tests in mobile apps, specifically mocking functions to simulate user use was interesting and not something I knew existed
- If you could do it over, what would you change?
  - I think I would want to work with my group members much more closely to deliver the code and functionality they needed faster.
- What is the most valuable thing you learned?
  - Communication is really important, not enough of it leads to stepping on toes and missing functionality others needed.

## Conclusion
- How successful was the project?
  - The project was fairly successful, as we were able to complete 13 out of 19 issues. We implemented the core features, including using a local database, adding and deleting Pokémon from teams, and using the Pokémon API for fetching data. Despite a few remaining issues, the major functionality was completed, and we delivered a working version of the app.
- What was the largest victory?
  - The largest victory was successfully integrating the Pokémon API with our SQLite database. Displaying Pokémon images dynamically on the app was a significant accomplishment, as it made the app visually engaging and allowed users to interact with their teams.
- Final assessment of the project
  - Overall, the project was a success. We delivered most of the key features, and the team worked efficiently to tackle unfamiliar technologies. Additionally, it provided valuable learning opportunities in React Native and mobile app development.
